# Hex Hover Converter

# License and Acknowledgements

This extension is based on the https://github.com/thegtproject/vscode-hoverhex by [Brandon/thegtproject](https://github.com/thegtproject) and originally was a pull request.
But the original project seems to be abandoned.
As it is MIT licensed I decided to use the extension skeleton from the original project and enhance the simple hex conversion into a more enhanced decimal-hex-binary conversion in all directions.

This extension is also MIT licensed.
