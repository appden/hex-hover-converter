# Hex Hover Converter

![](assets/hex-hover-converter.gif)


The "Hex Hover Converter" converts numbers into their decimal, hexadecimal and binary format.
You simply have to hover over the number with your mouse.
Conversion takes place in all directions. I.e. decimal is converted to hexadecimal and vice versa.
If there are more than one interpretations possible both conversions are shown.
Additionally it also converts negative values.


# Hovers in Debug Mode

vscode turns the normal hovers off if in debug mode. To make them visible press the "ALT" key while hovering.


# License and Acknowledgements

This extension is based on the https://github.com/thegtproject/vscode-hoverhex by [Brandon/thegtproject](https://github.com/thegtproject) and originally was a pull request.
But the original project seems to be abandoned.
As it is MIT licensed I decided to use the extension skeleton from the original project and enhance the simple hex conversion into a more enhanced decimal-hex-binary conversion in all directions.

This extension here is also MIT licensed.
